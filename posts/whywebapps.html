        <h3>Why Web Apps? Why not cholocate or fun things like the cloud?</h3>
        <!-- You should also rename the title at the top to this title -->
        <div class="blog-post">
          <div>Let me just start by saying that web apps are EVERYWHERE. They power so much of our lives. Anytime we look something up, use a SaaS app, look at a menu online... Anything with a screen shows web apps. We all know how common screens are in our lives.</div>
          <div>Heres my main point: I love the accessibility of web apps. Heck, I built this blog by pretty much writing everything out. I started this off from a homework exercise, but all of the writing and styling is done by hand. I did it. I really understand this web app. It doesn't know me, but I sure know it. </div>
          <div>The first question I would ask myself is: Why not cloud?</div>
          <div>I've actually spent the past few years on the cloud. I felt like it is the future. I need to know it. I've studied it a lot, and now have two certifications on it. I spend a lot of time in a cloud security product.</div>
          <div>So I'm a master at it now right? <em>Wrong.</em>I'm not a master at it. I'll tell you why - I'm somewhat convinced that you can't be a "10-000 hour master" of cloud unless a significant portion of that time has been managing a real environment. It is hard to build out a personal environment of great complexity due to the fact that cloud costs balloon out of control so quick. Budgets are a must have in AWS when homelabbing.</div>
          <div>Side Note: Azure free accounts are really locked down in terms of getting surprise bills. Highly recommend using Azure for practice. Its more fun because its less stress.</div>
          <div>I can deploy a complicated web app on my local host. No issue. Want to run a backend? No problem. Want to run it in Kubernetes? No problem, but a bit more setup. Want to run it on a container? No problem</div>
          <div>This leads me into point number 2: Web Apps are a main reason for even being in the cloud.</div>
          <div>Thus, I'll become even more of a cloud expert if I deeply understand web apps, because thats why the cloud is there. I am convinced that for heavy compute usage applications, there will be a constant and gradual shift back to on-prem for that. You can drastically reduce your cost there, but for web apps - You want those to be in a separate environment because they are opened right up, and theres no easier way to do that than in the cloud.</div>
          <div>Point Number 3: I love coding</div>
          <div>I grew to mostly hate, but also love coding during my Electrical Engineering degree at BYU-Idaho(Ended up switching to computer engineering to finish my degree two semesters quicker). We did a lot, and I mean a lot of programming in C++. I didn't touch python until my senior year in one class and then in my senior project. Now Python is like a good ol friend that I don't actually know well enough but use all the time because they are so willing to help. </div>
          <div>At that time I was a bit naive because I didn't realize how life hard was, and how minimal the crappy parts of coding were. Its so fun. I could spend all day, and all week coding. Now maybe if I did that full time as my career, I might say something different but thats trying to be honest.</div>
          <div>Now when I have a chance to code, I get enveloped and thoroughly enjoy it. The day goes better and I feel very satisfied. </div>
          <div>Case in point: Its midnight on a worknight, while I'm sick with covid and I got carried away building this blog and doing web development exercises. Usual between is somewhere between 9 and 10pm</div>
