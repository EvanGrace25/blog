        <h3>Why Security?</h3>
        <!-- You should also rename the title at the top to this title -->
        <div class="blog-post">
          <div>Here is my one example and I'll just say thank you very much... have a nice day: <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-leak-27-billion-data-records-with-social-security-numbers/">Possible Data breach involving 2.7 Billion Social Security Numbers</a></div>
          <div>The current population of the United States is 330 million according to my search, and this goes into 2.7 billion a total of 8.2 times. So lets just assume there are 8 duplicate records for each US citizen, then it could possibly include every American's SSN. </div>
          <div>Everybody deals with security, and security deals with everybody. </div>
          <div>My degree was originally in Embedded Systems (Electrical Engineering) thus my destiny was and always had been a robotics designer or process engineer on a factory floor. Once I realized how much this work was based off of massive projects or contracts, I wondered about the long term feasability of it. Now I know it would be very stable work but this is the thought I had at the time.</div>
          <div>Everybody and every company of <em>ANY</em> deals with security issues whether they know it or not. Its a commoners issue as well. Thats what drew me over initially. I had never considered moving over to cybersecurity pretty much the month before I decided to. Once I decided it was game over.</div>
          <div>I also wanted to be constantly learning. Love learning. One of the biggest things about security that I didn't realize at the time, was that a core tenet of cyber is to understand the systems that you are protecting. If you don't understand them, then how can you protect them?</div>
          <div>Thus started the journey we are on today of continually trying to broaden and deepen my understanding systems and their workings. Its an awesome journey!</div>
