          <div>Rant Time</div>
          <div>As a consumer, I am deeply annoyed by Apple. Lets say - Perturbed. </div>
          <div>Got a bran spankin new Macbook Pro in 2017. It was SLICK. </div>
          <div>2020 rolls around. The new M1 chip and Big Sur are released. Can‚Äôt update to it. Can‚Äôt update to a new OS after only 3 years, and security updates are supposedly over. Was kind of annoying but no biggie.</div>
          <div></div>
          <div>2024 - There are a significant amount of applications that don‚Äôt support High Sierra anymore. Heavily handicapped anytime I want to dig deep into something. Can‚Äôt run latest browsers or desired IDEs.</div>
          <div></div>
          <div>So what to do now:</div>
          <div>
            <ol>
                <li>Deal with it. Use different applications and find ways to backport it, and cut into precious study time. </li>
                <li>Buy a new Macbook Pro. I wouldn‚Äôt go for an Air, and would end up spending about $1500</li>
                <li>Buy a used 2020 M1 that will likely be unsupported in just a few years. The M line chips will probably get support longer than mine did. </li>
                <li>Move to windows (HA)</li>
                <li>Move to Linux</li>
            </ol>
          </div>
          <div></div>
          <h2>Privacy</h2>
          <div>Apple is putting Apple Intelligence into their new macs. I am not a fan of ecosystem-opt-in AI functionality.</div>
          <div>Windows already put AI into their Operating System and caused quite a stir around it, rightfully so.</div>
          <div>So we have two options to avoid my privacy concerns:</div>
          <div>
            <ol>
                <li>Unsupported MacOS</li>
                <li>Linux</li>
            </ol>
          </div>
          <div>I honestly didn‚Äôt think I would be switching to Linux as my main Operating System for a long time, but here we are. My brother Michael recently migrated over to ArchLinux and I think I will be doing the same. </div>
          <div>I will be purchasing another laptop, probably a 2017 Macbook Pro just like my current one to install Linux on it. </div>
          <div>Over the next couple years as I upgrade my phone, I will probably be leaving the apple ecosystem as well for a less convenient mobile OS, sadly. </div>

          <h2>Recap</h2>
          <div><em>So to recap: A big thanks to apple for giving their users the middle finger after purchasing nice and hanky spanky intel chip Macbooks pre 2020, and for putting apple intelligence into their new hardware and software. They pushed me to Linux as my main OS sooner than I expected.</em></div>
